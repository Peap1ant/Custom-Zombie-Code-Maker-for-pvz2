# Update History

### 0.1

- Release CZCM

### 0.2

- New dropbox system instead some entry box  
That`s better way then entry box  

- New sub-program : RG & AGG for Resource and Audio  
I think both in put need to be multiple lines so I made program for make both things easily  

- Now can add custom things in dropbos for mod stuff  
Speciak thanks to Haruma : make better way for dropbox and can add custom things

### 0.2.1

- Upload to Githup instead Google drive  
Github is better then G Drive because now can found by searching  

- Add dropbox for PF  
Better then entry box  

### 0.2.2

- Add dropbox for Pop Anim  
I forgot to make this to dropbox  

- Now don`t need to use C Drive only  
Use only C Drive only is bad idea, with f string, sys and os we can use CZCM at any folder!  
Speciak thanks to Nice Zombies : fix path problem

### 0.3

 - Add plant`s resource
 - New options for add all resource in RG  
For lazy people like me  

 - New Sub-program : Extra Code Generator (ECG) for Extra Codes  
It will generate some code for specific zombies or armors, etc  

ECG can make : 
 - Zombie Types Extra    
 - Zombie Properties Extra 
 - Custom Armor

 - Add dropbox for GroundTrackName  
Why I didn`t change this  

 - Add default values as basic zombie  
For easy add values 

 - Now all programs will place 0, 0 when open  
I used 240, 0 for window place, but now it`s 0, 0 now  
Best update in history

 - Fix bug which "prop" in CZCM`s Zombie Type Properties  
Yeah I forgot to delete that

 - Delete "--- Select from below options ---,", "--- Plant---". "--- Zombie ---" and "--- Custom ---" in options  
That`s good for selected option and adding Custom code, but that make a lots of no-meaningful codes so I deleted it

0.3 update will be last update in this year  
I have Korean SAT at November and I need to return the laptop to school which I using for CZCM  
I will return at 2023 January ~ March

### 0.3.1 (soon)

 - [ ] Add specific zombies codes in ECG
That`s for easy to make specific zombies more zombie will add in future update, 2323 :)
