## Note

* When You want to use multiple lines, you need to write in other json or txt files and copy-paste it
  I want make to enter key work in tool, but I can't so you need to use like that

* When you using exe file, need few sec to open because tech problem

* Also, CZCM is open source so I uploaded python code
  If you want edit CZCM and make more better version, that's fine
  but leave my nickname as original maker

* When you found bug with CZCM, DM me as ð“„µð“„¶ð“„³ð“„³ð“„¶ð“„µð“„¶ð“„³ð“„¶ð“„µð“„³ð“„µð“„¶#2806
