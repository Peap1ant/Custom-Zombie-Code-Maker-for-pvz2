# Update History

### 0.1

- Release CZCM

### 0.2

- New dropbox system instead some entry box  
That`s better way then entry box  

- New sub-program : RG & AGG for Resource and Audio  
I think both in put need to be multiple lines so I made program for make both things easily  

### 0.2.1

- Upload to Githup instead Google drive  
Github is better then G Drive because now can found by searching  

- Add dropbox for PF  
Better then entry box  

### 0.2.2 (soon)  

- Add dropbox for Pop Anim  
I forgot to make this to dropbox  

- Now don`t need to use C Drive only  
Use only C Drive only is bad idea, with f string and os we can use CZCM at any folder!

### 0.3 (soon)

 -  [ ] Add plant`s resource
 -  [ ] New options for add all resource in RG
 -  [ ] New Sub-program : Custom Action Generator (CAG) for make Custom action (maybe will be cancel)
